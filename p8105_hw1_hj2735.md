### Problem 1

``` r

    ## # ℹ 4 more variables: precip <dbl>, pressure <dbl>, visib <dbl>,
    ## #   time_hour <dttm>

The `early_january_weather` dataset contains 358 rows and 15 columns.  
The mean temperature during this period was 39.6 °F.  
Variables that are the same for all include:  
- `origin`, `year`, `month`, `day`, and `wind_gust`

Key variables inlcude:  
- `hour`: the exact hour of record  
- `temp`: temperature in °F of recorded time  
- `dewp`: dew point  
- `humid`: relative humidity  
- `wind_dir`: wind direction in degrees  
- `wind_speed`: wind speed  
- `precip`: precipitation in inches  
- `pressure`  
- `visib`  
- `time_hour`

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature vs Time in Early January",
    x = "Time (hourly)",
    y = "Temperature (°F)",
    color = "Humidity"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw1_hj2735_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot_temp_vs_time.png", width = 7, height = 5)
```

The scatterplot above shows temperature across time, with points colored
by humidity. As we move from Jan 01 to Jan 15, the temperature tend to
rise, and humidity tend to rise as well. The humidity tend to be highest
when temperature is between 40F to 50F, and Jan 10 to Jan 15.

### Problem 2

``` r
set.seed(8105)
df <- tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10),
  logical = sample > 0,
  character = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
  factor = factor(rep(c("low","medium","high"), length.out = 10),
                  levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
)

df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##     sample logical character factor
    ##      <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>     <fct> 
    ##  1  0.674  TRUE    A         low   
    ##  2  1.31   TRUE    B         medium
    ##  3  0.115  TRUE    C         high  
    ##  4  1.07   TRUE    D         low   
    ##  5  0.155  TRUE    E         medium
    ##  6  2.12   TRUE    F         high  
    ##  7 -0.219  FALSE   G         low   
    ##  8 -0.113  FALSE   H         medium
    ##  9 -0.0651 FALSE   I         high  
    ## 10  0.476  TRUE    J         low

``` r
mean(df %>% pull(sample))       # works (numeric)
```

    ## [1] 0.5520184

``` r
mean(df %>% pull(logical))      # works (TRUE=1, FALSE=0 → proportion >0)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(df %>% pull(character))    # fails (not numeric)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df %>% pull(character)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(df %>% pull(factor))       # fails (factors not directly numeric)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df %>% pull(factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
as.numeric(df$logical)     # TRUE → 1, FALSE → 0
as.numeric(df$character)   # characters → NA (cannot be coerced)
as.numeric(df$factor)      # factors → underlying integer codes
```

Taking the mean of the numeric sample works as expected, since these are
standard Normal draws. The mean of the logical vector also works because
R coerces `TRUE` to 1 and `FALSE` to 0, so the result represents the
proportion of positive values in the sample. Attempting to take the mean
of the character vector fails because character data cannot be
meaningfully converted to numeric values. The mean of the factor
variable also fails by default, because factors are categorical rather
than numeric.

After applying `as.numeric()`, the logical vector is converted to 0s and
1s. The character vector becomes `NA`, since characters cannot be
coerced into numbers. The factor vector converts to its underlying
integer codes, and because I explicitly defined the levels (`low = 1`,
`medium = 2`, `high = 3`), the numeric representation is consistent with
our intended ordering. This explains why numeric and logical means
succeed, why character means fail, and why factor means depend on the
coding of levels.
