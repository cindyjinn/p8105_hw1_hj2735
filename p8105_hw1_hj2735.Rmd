## Homework 1

This is an R Markdown document created for homework 1, by Haixin Jin, hj2735

```{r Problem 1}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")

# Preview dataset
head(early_january_weather)
```

The `early_january_weather` dataset contains `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.  
The mean temperature during this period was `r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE), 1)` °F.  
Variables that are the same for all include:  
- `origin`, `year`, `month`, `day`, and `wind_gust`

Key variables inlcude:  
- `hour`: the exact hour of record  
- `temp`: temperature in °F of recorded time  
- `dewp`: dew point  
- `humid`: relative humidity  
- `wind_dir`: wind direction in degrees  
- `wind_speed`: wind speed  
- `precip`: precipitation in inches  
- `pressure`  
- `visib`   
- `time_hour`  

``` {r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature vs Time in Early January",
    x = "Time (hourly)",
    y = "Temperature (°F)",
    color = "Humidity"
  )

ggsave("scatterplot_temp_vs_time.png", width = 7, height = 5)
```
The scatterplot above shows temperature across time, with points colored by humidity. Warmer temperatures tend to appear in the daytime hours, and periods of high humidity often align with warmer temperatures. Overall, we can see that when time rises (approaching daytime), temperature rises and humidity increases.
